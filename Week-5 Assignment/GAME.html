    <p> Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows. 
    Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020
    followed by a release on June 2, 2020. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures
    around the world. In the main game mode,players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having 
    five players on it. You have 13 rounds to attack and defend your side using sharp gunplay and tactical abilities. And, with one
    life per-round, you'll need to think faster than your opponent if you want to survive. Take on foes across Competitive and
    Unranked modes as well as Deathmatch and Spike Rush.</p>
